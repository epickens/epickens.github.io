Follow along with me on my path to learning about all things related to data. 

Data is everywhere, but it seems to me that there is a distinct lack of material that clearly explains how it can be used effectively. My goal for this blog is create a series of tutorials to help those interested in statistics, mathematics, data science, and computer science better understand how we can harness data for good. 

Hopefully this blog will blossom into something more engaging than just a bunch of R and Python cookbooks, but to be honest I'm not quite sure what this blog is going to become.
