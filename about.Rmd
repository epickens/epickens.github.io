I'm currently a PhD student in the Computer and Information Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. Before coming to Philadelphia, I was a predoctoral research fellow at MSRNYC, where I was lucky to be advised by David Rothschild. I also spent time at UW-Madison, Cornell Tech (where I got a master's in ORIE), and Carleton College (where I earned a BA in Mathematics).

Follow along with me on my path to learning about all things related to data. 

This blog is both a place where I write about the various things I'm interested in and a repository for some of my past work. There's a lot of writing on mathematics, statistics, and computer science out there and this is my way of adding to it. It is also an opportunity to practice my communication skills. I can't say that all of my posts are great examples of technical communication, but I hope that at some point in the future they will be. So stay tuned! I might put out a good post at some point in the future!

Data is everywhere, but it seems to me that there is a distinct lack of material that clearly explains how it can be used effectively. My goal for this blog is create a series of tutorials to help those interested in statistics, mathematics, data science, and computer science better understand how we can harness data for good. 

Hopefully this blog will blossom into something more engaging than just a bunch of R and Python cookbooks, but to be honest I'm not quite sure what this blog is going to become.
